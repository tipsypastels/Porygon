what still sucks

- embeds are repetitive
- check permissions instead of time instead of catching in block
- "Permissions." just pass a symbol, dude
- long translation keys
- sharing lines between commands?
- .description=
- force set access to ensure security correctness
- maybe use a register macro instead of self setters
- command has too many mixins
- write your own i18n instead, instead of definining "#t" all over the place, make a static method that returns a proc or something? and then be able to make further procs based on that. and define them as constants so you can reach around namespaces.
