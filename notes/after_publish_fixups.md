things that aren't important enough to delay publishing but you should definitely do at some point

- mute/unmute error if you already do/don't have the role
- rotating activity?
- cooltrainer i guess
- more granularity for where logs go
- public join/leave log
- error checking for specific roles that cannot be edited, like roles above pory's
- adding packages automagically to all new channels for duck com
- manually calling destroy all on EnabledPackage doesn't update cache, maybe not calling hooks? never happens in practice but nice to fix
