# A factory for making user-facing error messages that can make use of locales.
# Throw it with a translation key instead of a human readable string.
#
# However, the translation value will *not* be used as the error message itself,
# the key will. That's because in the primary use case (command errors), we want
# to point the key to something that is not a string, such as a translation hash
# for an embed. Error messages cannot contain strings, so we instead throw the
# key and catch it later.
#
# You can get the translated value, which may be a non-string value, using the
# +translated_value+ method. You can also look up keys within it using +key+,
# which is needed for hashes as I18n does not interpolate into a hash result.
