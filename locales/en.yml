  changelog:
    14:
      desc: 'The long-awaited (by me putting it off) package update.'
      changes:
        - 'Packages can now be enabled per-channel.'
        - "`%{pre}commands` now respects the user's permissions."
        - "Added `%{pre}enablePackage`, `%{pre}disablePackage`, and `%{pre}packageList`."
        - "Added superglobal packages, which cannot be enabled or disabled but can only be applied to a subset of members. The current superglobals are `operator`, which contains debugging permissions, and `package`, which contains package management itself and is only usable to server admins."
    13:
      changes:
        - 'Porygon can now log join, leave, message delete, kick, and ban events in the mod log channel if one is set.'
        - 'Added `%{pre}unmute` and `%{pre}setMutedRole`, which were previously omitted.'
    12:
      desc: No new commands! Just lots of backend stuff.
      changes:
        - 'Changed the way commands are registered, now uses a macro instead of searching through the ancestry tree for children of `Commands::Command`.'
        - 'Split permissions into three systems - member permissions, bot permissions, and owner only permissions.'
        - "Removed bot permission error handling, the bot now checks its permissions ahead of time. This enables better errors as it can tell you exactly what permission it's missing instead of a generic message."
        - "`%{pre}help`, `%{pre}commands`, and `%{pre}!` are now usable in DMs."
        - "All commands now show up in `%{pre}commands`, even ones the user does not have permission to use. This will change later once package hiding is introduced."
    11:
      changes:
        - 'Removed, split, and merged some packages.'
        - 'Packages are now derived from the filesystem instead of explicitly defined.'
        - 'Removed some unused error utilities and simplified `TranslatedError`.'
        - 'Shorter syntax for defining command arguments.'
        - "Added back the `%{pre}package` command, but it doesn't do much yet."
        - "Added `%{pre}globalIgnore` and `%{pre}globalUnignore`."
        - "Added `%{pre}botIgnore` and `%{pre}botUnignore`."
    10:
      changes:
        - 'Turned off Discordrb logging.'
        - 'Add logging of command usage and errors.'
        - 'For security, commands now default to disabled in DMs unless explicitly set otherwise.'
        - 'Added Ruby-style setter command syntax, where `%{pre}x = ...` is an alias for `%{pre}setx ...`.'
        - 'Added `%{pre}renameServer` and `%{pre}renameChannel`.'
        - 'Rebuilt the permission checks system.'
    9:
      changes:
        - 'Fixed translations for converters inside namespaces.'
        - '`#` is now allowed at the front of a `Porygon::Version` argument.'
    8:
      desc: 'The poll update.'
      changes:
        - 'Added `%{pre}poll`.'
    7:

        - "Rewrote arguments parsing (again)"

    6:
      changes:
        - "Added `%{pre}thanos`."
    5:

        - "Renamed package `debug` to `meta`."
    2:

      changes:
        - "Added `%{pre}help` and `%{pre}commands`."
        - "Pory is back to generating one sentence instead of two. Funnier."
        - "You can put multiple words in command options now by wrapping them in quotes, such as `%{pre}flip -h \"do it\" -t \"don't do it\"`."
        - "`%{pre}calc` is much smarter now, has better error messages and lets you define variables in a block at the beginning `%{pre}calc x = 1, y = 2 || x + y`."
        - "Re-broke `%{pre}dice` working with zero rolls. For now."
